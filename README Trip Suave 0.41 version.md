# Trip Suave

My goal here was to start learning Python, with projects that would have practical use in everyday life.

I had the idea of ​​putting together a script that calculates fuel expenses on trips.

After all, on outings with friends, when everyone shares the bills, it's not expensive for anyone.

I'm still having trouble solving the things below:

1) possibly there is a better solution for working with two decimal places than using ROUND on all results.

2) in Brazil you don't use "." to separate decimal places, but ",". I want to find a non-code-damaging way to modify this.

3) Sentences that have a punctuation after a string followed by "," always have a blank space added. This makes it aesthetically ugly. I'll find a way to fix this too.
